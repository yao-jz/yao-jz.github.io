excerpt: 'Dialogue in stories always has lots of unique features, such as moving the plot forward, developing characters, etc. While human writers can build characters and use dialogue to connect different plots to construct a complete story, it is hard for machines to specifically understand and generate story dialogue, considering the massive context information around. To encourage research in this field of story dialogue understanding and generation, we construct a Dataset DialStory and introduced two new tasks on our dataset: Mask Dialogue Generation and Speaker Recognition. Since dialogue in stories always has a strong connection with characters, whatever in styles or moods, we also proposed a multi-character modeling approach to facilitate story dialogue understanding and generation. Our experiments on these two tasks demonstrate that our model can better encode the character representation in stories and outperforms the baseline on these tasks to a certain degree and there is great importance on further story dialogue research.'
