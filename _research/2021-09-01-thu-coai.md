In this year's research experience, I went from first meeting NLP, to contributing to an open-source dialogue system, and leading one research project on my own. This stimulated my strong interest in NLP, and accumulated experience in doing research independently.

### A Benchmark for Understanding and Generating Dialogue between Characters in Stories

In this paper, we present the first study to explore whether machines can understand and generate dialogue in stories. We propose two tasks: Mask Dialogue Generation and Dialogue Speaker Recognition. We also build a new story dataset DialStory consists of annotated dialogue/speakers. What's more, we implement a character-modeling approach to improve the performance of transformer-based models.

### EVA2.0: Investigating Open-Domain Chinese Dialogue Systems with Large-Scale Pre-Training

We propose EVA2.0, a large-scale pre-trained open-domain Chinese dialogue model with 2.8 billion parameters. I am mainly responsible for preprocessing training data and implementing some different decoding strategies. Because the dialogue model always generates some contradictory or inconsistent responses, I also do experiments on the contradiction detection approaches.

### Contradictory Response Detection Model and Pipeline

The contradictory/inconsistent responses are very common in the open-domain dialogue system, so I developed a contradiction detection model for our Chinese Chatbot EVA. When the classifier detects one contradiction, I force the chatbot to regenerate the response and recheck the consistency.
