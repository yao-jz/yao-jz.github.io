### Research on rotation invariance of image local features in object reconstruction based on deep learning method

In this project, I observe and report on the effect of image transformation on feature extraction and matching in SuperPoint, D2-Net, SuperGlue, and Sift.

I used the shoe models as subjects to conduct the experiments. To do image transformation, I tried the
