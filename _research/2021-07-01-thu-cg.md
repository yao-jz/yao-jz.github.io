### Research on rotation invariance of image local features in object reconstruction based on deep learning method

In this project, I observe and report on the effect of image transformation on feature extraction and matching in SuperPoint, D2-Net, SuperGlue, and SIFT.

I use the shoe images as subjects to conduct the experiments. For transformation, I do object rotation, style transformation, affine transformation, compression and stretching transformation. Affected by the bias of training data, I found some deep learning models didn't beat the traditional algorithms like SIFT. So how to sample or generate more general training data for data augmentation is a critical problem in this area.

<!-- For the image rotation transformation, I implement the flip matrix with average pooling to get the images' feature representation, and compare the matching performance with the baseline.

As we can see from the picture, when the rotation angle is small, the matching performance is both satisfying. But as the rotation angle increases, the number of matching points decreases, but the matching performance of Flip Matrix is better than the baseline. So the max pooling from different flip matrix can reduce the effect of rotation on matching. -->
