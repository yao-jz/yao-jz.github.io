In Wang Lab, I first came across the biomedical Ã— NLP research. I found myself also interested in the biomedical cross-field, and very excited about the potential research opportunities. By conducting research independently, I have gained a better understanding of the intersection of the two fields.

We used OPT for knowledge enhanced in-context question generation, and constructed a biomedical QA dataset for downstream applications(like dataset recommendation). I also performed a recursive retrieval approach with UMLS, and implemented GCN for retrieval tree embedding to incorporate more information into the recommendation process.
