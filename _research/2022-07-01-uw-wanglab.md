By conducting a research independently, I have gained a better understanding of the intersection of the two fields.

### Biomedical Terminology Definition Generation Evaluation metrics for Faithfulness and AMR-based Generation approach

Existing automatic evaluation metrics like BLEU or ROUGH can't evaluate the faithfulness and accuracy of the definition perfectly. So we try to design semantic-level evaluation metrics for factual and keywords problem of the generated definition. And we also try to use the AMR to facilitate the definition generation.
