Winter Swimming Association at Tsinghua University is mainly composed of elderly teachers and graduate students, and we often go swimming together no matter raining or snowing.

Although the pool is frozen in winter, we can break the ice, and the water temperature is about three degrees.

Swimming outside in winter is very refreshing and relaxing. And in the winter swimming association, I made lots of friends. We share the swimming experience and interesting things in our life.
