In Microsoft Research Asia, the working environment is quite different from the lab in Tsinghua University. The environment is more comfortable, and there are many colleagues to share new papers and exchange ideas on our research.

With sufficient computing resources, I can independently design and conduct experiments under the guidance of my mentor. The regular meeting/talking also allows us to share and keep track of the academic frontiers.

Their support and enthusiasm for research enrich my existing knowledge by a large step and broaden my horizons. I am deeply impressed by their ability to capture hot topics in academic frontiers and I have gained a lot.
