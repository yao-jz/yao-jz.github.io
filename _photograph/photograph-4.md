I took some dance classes at Tsinghua University. Different from other sports, without the pressure and tension of competitions, dancing provides me with more exercise for better coordination, agility, and flexibility. It can also strengthen my connection with music, other dancers, even myself.

All in all, dancing helps me lower my stress, and keeps me happy and energetic throughout the semester.
