Hello, I'm Jianzhu Yao!

I am a junior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My primary research interests are in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I also have broad interests in Mixture of Experts, Multimodal Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Distributed Computing techniques for Deep Learning models.

For Natural Language Processing, most of my previous research focuses on the dialogue system, consistency and faithful problems, NLP in the story domain and biomedical domain. I am also very excited about the research field of Language + {Vision, Multimodal Information, Knowledge, Memory, MoE...}.

I am now a research intern at [NLP group](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp) of [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), Seattle, working with Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/), working on biomedical definition faithfulness evaluation. Before that, I am honored to work with Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml) in [CoAI](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group, where I led a research topic independently, finished my first first-author paper, and contributed to an Open-Domain Dialogue System [EVA1.0 and EVA2.0](https://github.com/thu-coai/EVA).

I also interned at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA), Natural Language Computing Group, working with Dr. [Tao Ge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tage/).

Publications
============

## [A Benchmark for Understanding and Generating Dialogue between Characters in Stories](https://yao-jz.github.io/publications/)

**Jianzhu Yao**, Ziqi Liu, Jian Guan, Minlie Huang

*EMNLP 2022, under review*

Propose two tasks **DialGen** and **DialSpk** to evaluate the model's ability of understanding and generating dialogue between characters in stories. We also built a new dataset **DIalStory**, which consists of 105k Chinese stories with a large amount of dialogue weaved into the plots to support the evaluation. We also proposed learning explicit character representations to improve performance on these tasks.

[EVA2.0: Investigating Open-Domain Chinese Dialogue Systems with Large-Scale Pre-Training](https://yao-jz.github.io/publications/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuxian Gu, Jiaxin Wen, Hao Sun, Yi Song, Pei Ke, Chujie Zheng, Zheng Zhang, **Jianzhu Yao**, Xiaoyan Zhu, Jie Tang, Minlie Huang

*arXiv:2203.09313, EMNLP 2022, under review*

Propose **EVA2.0**, a large-scale pre-trained open-domain Chinese dialogue model with 2.8 billion parameters, which is also the largest open-source Chinese dialogue model. We also conduct extensive experiments to investigate some decoding strategies and prevent the contradictory generation of our system.

# Hobbies

I like most kinds of sports, like running, dancing, winter swimming, swimming, bodybuilding, football, basketball, etc. I have completed half marathons and 10k races, and now I am also preparing for the 2022 Capital University student Bodybuilding and Fitness Competition. Sports make me full of energy and motivation in my research life and they can even promote my ability to think creatively.
