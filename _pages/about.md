Hello, I'm Jianzhu Yao!

I am a senior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My primary research interests are in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Multimodal Machine Learning. I also have broad interests in Mixture of Experts, and Distributed Computing techniques for Deep Learning models.

I am now a research intern at Zhou Group in Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Bowen Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=h3Nsz6YAAAAJ), working on the helpfulness prediction and fake detection of multimodal reviews. Before that, I am honored to work in the [NLP group](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp) of [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), Seattle, working with Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/), working on biomedical information retrieval and dataset recommendations. I am also honored to work with Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml) in [CoAI](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group, where I constructed a story dialogue dataset, and contributed to an Open-Domain Dialogue System [EVA1.0 and EVA2.0](https://github.com/thu-coai/EVA).

I also interned at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA), Natural Language Computing Group, working with Dr. [Tao Ge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tage/).

<!-- ## [SciData: Dataset and Method for Scientific Dataset Recommendation](https://yao-jz.github.io/publications/)

**Jianzhu Yao\***, Zichun Yu\*(equal contribution), Haihong Tang, Jinxiong Xia, Zequn Liu, Sheng Wang

*Submitted to The 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. (ACL 2023)*

Constructed a novel scientific dataset recommendation **dataset** for scientific QA using the open pre-trained transformer (OPT-1.3B), with 43466 scientific datasets and over 200K questions. We proposed a **recursive retrieval** approach for the dataset recommendation task, outperforming strong baselines by a large margin. We also illustrated how our dataset can be used for citation prediction and improve existing scientific QA systems in low-resource settings. -->

## [A Benchmark for Understanding and Generating Dialogue between Characters in Stories](https://yao-jz.github.io/publications/)

**Jianzhu Yao**, Ziqi Liu, Jian Guan, Minlie Huang

*Submitted to The 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. (ACL 2023)*

Propose two tasks **DialGen** and **DialSpk** to evaluate the model's ability of understanding and generating dialogue between characters in stories. We built a new dataset **DialStory**, which consists of 105k Chinese stories with a large amount of dialogue weaved into the plots to support the evaluation. We also proposed learning explicit character representations to improve performance on these tasks.

[EVA2.0: Investigating Open-Domain Chinese Dialogue Systems with Large-Scale Pre-Training](https://yao-jz.github.io/publications/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuxian Gu, Jiaxin Wen, Hao Sun, Yi Song, Pei Ke, Chujie Zheng, Zheng Zhang, **Jianzhu Yao**, Xiaoyan Zhu, Jie Tang, Minlie Huang

*Machine Intelligence Research, 2022*

Propose **EVA2.0**, a large-scale pre-trained open-domain Chinese dialogue model with 2.8 billion parameters, which is also the largest open-source Chinese dialogue model. We also conduct extensive experiments to investigate some decoding strategies and prevent the contradictory generation of our system.

# Hobbies

I like most kinds of sports, like running, dancing, winter swimming, swimming, bodybuilding, football, basketball, etc. I have completed half marathons and 10k races, and now I am also preparing for the 2022 Capital University student Bodybuilding and Fitness Competition. Sports make me full of energy and motivation in my research life and they can even promote my ability to think creatively.
